# genetic_algorithms
GA_SSB.py is an implementation of a genetic algorithm used to optimize an analytical fixed-fixed beam bending problem.
The objectives are to: 
** 1) minimize deflection at the point of load application  
** 2) minimize cost by optimizing the I-beam shape given a fixed price per unit mass

GA_OneMax_example.py is an example from Genetic Algorithms with Python (by E. Wirsnasky)
